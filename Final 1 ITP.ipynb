    "#### 8. Write a python program for monthly finance management system. The program should ask the user about the salary/pocket money that a person gets for a month. Then it should ask the user monthly about how much he spends on rent, food, travel, health and miscellaneous. At the end of every month it should display about the money that the user saved in that month. At the MONTH end, it should tell the complete summary of how much a person earned, saved, invested and spent on various things. You should give a choice to the user whether he wants to enter any other expense monthly or not. If yes, please ask about the extra expenditures and include it in the summary. Any innovation in this basic model will be given weightage in marks. (15 Marks)"
