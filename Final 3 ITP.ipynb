Ram has certain conditions for the name: ( 5 Marks)( 5 Marks)( 5 Marks) ( 5 Marks)( 5 Marks) 1. It should consist of exactly three distinct characters, say C1, C2 and C3 2. It should satisfy the criteria that the string was of the form - C1n C2n C3n: This means, first C1 occurs n times, then C2 occurs n times and then C3 occurs n times. For example, xyz, ccaarr, mmmiiiaaa satisfy the criteria, but xyzw, aabbbcccc don't. Given N names suggested by Shyam, print \"OK\" if Ram likes the name and \"Not OK\" if he doesn't. Input: First-line contains a single positive integer N - the number of names. N lines follow - each line contains a name. Output: For each name, Print \"OK\" if the name satisfies the criteria, else print \"Not OK\", on a new line.

Don’t forget about things like IV being 4 and XL being 40.(15 Marks 15 Marks15 Marks15 Marks15 Marks ) Integer numbers and their Roman equivalent: 1000 : 'M' 900 : 'CM' 500 : 'D' 400 : 'CD' 100 : 'C' 90 : 'XC' 50 : 'L' 40 : 'XL' 10 : 'X' 9 : 'IX' 5 : 'V' 4: 'IV' 1: 'I' SAMPLE INPUT: Enter number to Convert : 417 SAMPLE OUTPUT: CDXVII"
